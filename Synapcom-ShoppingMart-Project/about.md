# Synapcom E-Commerce Analytics ‚Äì End-to-End Microsoft Fabric Data Engineering Project

## üìå Project Overview
This project demonstrates an **End-to-End E-Commerce Analytics Data Engineering Pipeline** using **Microsoft Fabric Medallion Architecture** (Bronze ‚Üí Silver ‚Üí Gold layers).  
It includes **structured and unstructured data ingestion**, transformation using **Fabric Notebooks**, and final **Power BI reporting** built on a semantic model.

**Grateful to Reena for her exceptional teaching and guidance** ‚Äì this project wouldn‚Äôt have been possible without her support.

## üèó Architecture

![Project Architecture](architecture.jpg)

The solution follows the **Medallion Architecture**:
- **Bronze Layer** ‚Üí Raw data ingestion (Structured + Unstructured)
- **Silver Layer** ‚Üí Data cleaning, transformation, and normalization
- **Gold Layer** ‚Üí Aggregated and curated datasets for analytics & reporting

---

## üìÇ Datasets Used
- **Structured Files**:  
  - `orders_data.csv`  
  - `customers.csv`  
  - `products.csv`  

- **Unstructured Files**:  
  - `reviews.json`  
  - `social_media.json`  
  - `web_logs.json`  

---

## üõ† Microsoft Fabric Services Used
- **Lakehouse** (Bronze, Silver, Gold)
- **Data Pipelines**
- **Notebooks** (PySpark / Pandas transformations)
- **Power BI Semantic Model**
- **Power BI Service for Reporting**

## üìú Detailed Steps

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Workspace & Architecture Setup
- Created a workspace **`Synapcom-ShoppingMart-Analytics-WS`**.
- Selected **pre-designed Medallion Architecture task flow**.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Bronze Layer ‚Äì Data Ingestion
#### Structured Data
1. Created Lakehouse **`ShoppingMart_BronzeLayer_LH`**.
2. Created pipeline **`ShoppingMart_DataIngest_Bronze_pipeline`**.
3. Added **Copy Data Activity** (`Copy_ShoppingMart_BronzeLayer_UsingAPI`) with **HTTP Connector**.
4. Configured source API URL & tested connection ‚úÖ.
5. Destination set as `ShoppingMartBronze/Orders`.
6. Pipeline run ‚Üí Orders file successfully created in Bronze Lakehouse.
7. Copied activity for **metadata ingestion** (`Copy_ShoppingMart_MetaData`).
8. Loaded metadata into `ShoppingMart_SourceMetadata/StructuredDataFiles`.
9. Added **Lookup** and **ForEach** activities to loop over structured CSV files.
10. All 3 CSV files successfully ingested into Bronze Lakehouse.

#### Unstructured Data
1. Saved structured pipeline as `ShoppingMart_Unstructured_DataIngest_Bronze_pipeline`.
2. Modified source & destination for unstructured JSON files.
3. Configured lookup & ForEach activities.
4. Successfully ingested all 3 unstructured JSON files into Bronze Lakehouse.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Silver Layer ‚Äì Transformation
1. Created Lakehouse **`ShoppingMart_SilverLayer_LH`**.
2. Developed transformation notebook **`NotebookSilverTransformationsShoppingMartData`**.
3. Created **shortcuts** to read from Bronze Lakehouse.
4. Cleaned structured data ‚Üí wrote results as parquet files in Silver Layer.
5. Created shortcuts for unstructured data ‚Üí transformed & stored in Silver Layer as parquet.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Gold Layer ‚Äì Aggregation & Curation
1. Created Lakehouse **`ShoppingMart_GoldLayer_LH`**.
2. Created notebook **`NotebookGoldTransformation_ShoppingMart`**.
3. Created shortcuts to Silver Layer data.
4. Performed business aggregations & transformations.
5. Wrote final curated datasets to Gold Lakehouse (Parquet format).

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Delta Tables & Semantic Model
1. Loaded final datasets as **Delta Tables**.
2. Created a **Semantic Model** from Gold Layer tables.
3. Built relationships between fact & dimension tables.
4. Created a **Date Table** and linked it with Orders.
5. Adjusted datatypes and column formatting.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Power BI Reporting
1. Built Power BI report **directly in Fabric Service** on the Semantic Model.
2. Created visualizations for key KPIs, trends, and sales insights.

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Master Orchestration Pipeline
1. Created **`ShoppingMart_Master_pipeline`**.
2. Added **Invoke Pipeline** for Structured Ingestion.
3. Added **Invoke Pipeline** for Unstructured Ingestion.
4. Added **Notebook Activity** for Silver Layer transformations.
5. Added **Notebook Activity** for Gold Layer transformations.
6. Ran the Master Pipeline ‚Üí all processes executed successfully ‚úÖ.

---

## üìä Final Output
- **Automated ingestion** of structured & unstructured data.
- **Clean, aggregated datasets** stored in Lakehouse.
- **Semantic model** with relationships for reporting.
- **Power BI dashboards** providing e-commerce analytics insights.
