# 🚦 Bengaluru Smart City Traffic Monitoring using Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a **real-time traffic monitoring solution** using **Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence (RTI)**.

The solution simulates live traffic data from major Bengaluru traffic junctions, streams the events into Microsoft Fabric, stores them in a KQL Database, and visualizes traffic insights through a Real-Time Dashboard.

The project showcases how organizations can leverage Microsoft Fabric for:

* Real-time event ingestion
* Streaming analytics
* Traffic congestion monitoring
* Smart city use cases
* Interactive operational dashboards

## 🔄 Data Flow

1. Python Notebook generates synthetic traffic telemetry data.
2. Fabric Eventstream receives streaming traffic events.
3. Events are stored in Fabric Eventhouse (KQL Database).
4. KQL queries process and analyze traffic telemetry.
5. Real-Time Dashboard visualizes live traffic insights.
6. Users monitor congestion, vehicle flow, speed, and waiting times.
